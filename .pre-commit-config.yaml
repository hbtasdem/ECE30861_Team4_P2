# This pre-commit will do the same thing as the python-lint.yml
# python-lint.yaml runs on every pull request 
# this will run every time you commit 

# HOW TO CONFIGURE:
# 1) pip install pre-commit 
# 2) ./run install
# 3) pre-commit install
# 4) optional: pre-commit autoupdate

# HOW TO USE:
# pre-commit run --all-files
# OR pre-commit run --files specificfile.py

# fought so much to get pre-commit working. 
# Conclusion: if you downloaded python from microsoft store pre-commit won't work.
#      have to uninstall, clear a bunch of stuff, then reinstall from python.org.
#      But then... the run file only works locally if I replace the top shebang
#      python3 to just python
